// The daemon and its attached client both write session state, and they write
// different parts of it. The daemon owns what a user would be surprised to lose
// across a detach and reattach: which windows exist, what they are called, which
// workspace they are on, whether they are minimized, and what is focused. The
// client owns what is derived from its own viewport or is purely visual: pixel
// geometry, z-order, the shell-reported title, pre-restore geometry, alt-screen
// state, and the tiling topology it computes.
//
// A client sync does not replace the whole state, because that would silently
// undo any daemon-side mutation made after the client built its snapshot. On
// the fields the daemon owns, the daemon's value wins whenever the client is
// demonstrably behind.

// ever sets, so a sync that simply omits them does not wipe them. Options come
// from the JSON verb protocol; Cwd is captured daemon-side from the live shell
